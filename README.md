# gym_session
A tool to create a balanced training session on the go. Thanks for @henu for the original idea. Needed for gym practice!



## Demo

## Mathematical model

The idea of the first version is to create a stateless no-memory website that will randomize a gym session iterating it so that it would cover as many as possible muscle groups and variability on reps. Over time all the muscle groups would then develop balanced counting on the random distribution. Other training methods like "legs only" or "cardio" are planned.
